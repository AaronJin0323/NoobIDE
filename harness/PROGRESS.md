# Progress log

Newest entry first. Every session appends one entry using the template at the bottom. `session.mjs start` shows
the latest entry to the next session, so write it for a reader with zero context.

## Session 0 — 2026-10-14 — Plan structured, harness built

**Agent:** Claude (cloud workspace, files handed back to `D:\NoobIDE`; no shell on the Windows machine)

**Done**

- S00.1 — Read PLAN.md and turned it into 9 milestones, 30 sessions, 129 agent features and 8 owner tasks
  (`harness/features.json`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`).
- Harness: `AGENTS.md` (session protocol + invariants), `CLAUDE.md`, `harness/session.mjs` (start/status/next/show/
  set/check with dependency checks and a tamper guard against the last commit), `harness/verify.mjs` (all gates).
- Toolchain skeleton: TypeScript 6.0.3 (strict), Vitest 5.0.4, ESLint 10 + typescript-eslint 8.71 (with the
  `process.platform` restriction outside `src/platform`), Prettier 3.9, `.gitattributes` LF policy, PLAN §6 folders
  with module READMEs, `src/shared/result.ts` + tests.

**Evidence:** `npm run verify` green in the cloud workspace (Linux, Node 22.22): harness, typecheck, lint, format,
5 unit tests.

**Decisions**

- TypeScript pinned to 6.0.3, not 7.0 — typescript-eslint 8.71 supports `<6.1`. Revisit when it supports 7.
- No `package-lock.json` committed yet: generate it on the Windows machine with the first `npm install` and commit
  it (avoids cross-platform optional-dependency gaps in a Linux-generated lockfile).
- Electron/Forge/React/Monaco are deliberately not installed yet; S02 picks and pins them with a decision record.
- Status changes go through `session.mjs set`; features can be superseded, never deleted or weakened.

**Problems / risks**

- Not yet run on Windows. First Windows session must run `npm install` + `npm run verify` and fix anything
  platform-specific.
- S06.1 needs a GitHub repository (H.5); S01.4 needs minimum OS versions (H.1).

**Next up**

1. S00.2 — `git init`, commit, verify the LF policy (`git ls-files --eol`).
2. S01 (scope docs + wireframes) and S02 (Electron scaffold) can run in either order or in parallel.
3. Owner: H.1, H.2, H.4 are unblocked now.
